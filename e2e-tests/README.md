# Cifuzz E2E tests

Cifuzz supports a growing list of behaviors. Multiplied by the number of supported operating systems, environment setups etc. it's a lot of combinations.

- Command
- Arguments and their combinations
- Operating system
- Environment and its setup. E.g., `CIFUZZ_PRERELEASE=true`, tooling flags or config files and their state.
- Tooling versions. E.g., Gradle versions we rely on. Or Jazzer version.
- State of SaaS Auth
- [...]

This end-to-end matrix test is not meant to replace our Integration tests! Our Integration tests cover complex scenarios in detail.
The E2E matrix is a way for us to have **a high-level, but wide test** coverage for the CLI.

> **Note**
> Tests are currently not blocking PRs or Releases.

They run after every release and on a nightly schedule.

- Nightly tests are using `make install` and code that's available in the repository.
- The release tests are run once, on Release publish, using the latest `curl | sh` installation method, to simulate the user installing it.

## Sample

> When I call `cifuzz bundle --help`
> Then the exit code is 0
> And there is expected help output

```go
func TestHelpArgsWithSubcommands(t *testing.T) {
	e2e.RunTest(t, &e2e.Test{
		Command: "bundle",
		Args:    []string{"--help"},
		Assert: func(t *testing.T, output e2e.CommandOutput) {
			assert.EqualValues(t, 0, output.ExitCode)
			assert.Contains(t, output.Stdout, "This command bundles all runtime artifacts")
		},
	})
}
```

See tests related to `cifuzz help` command in the `/help` folder for more examples.
