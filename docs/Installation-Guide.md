# Installation Guide

## Installation Directories

### Linux/MacOS

When running the installer as a **non-root** user, files are installed to:

* `~/.local/share/cifuzz` (default) or
* `$XDG_DATA_HOME/cifuzz` if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set.

A symlink to the `cifuzz` executable is created in `~/.local/bin/cifuzz`.

When running the installer as **root**, files are installed to
`/opt/code-intelligence/cifuzz` and a symlink to the `cifuzz` executable
if created in `/usr/local/bin/cifuzz`.

### Windows

All files are installed to `%APPDATA%/cifuzz` with the executable located
in `%APPDATA%/cifuzz/bin`.

### Linux / macOS

#### Version < 0.7.0

If you installed cifuzz into the default directory as **root**:

If you installed cifuzz as **root**:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /opt/code-intelligence/cifuzz /usr/local/bin/cifuzz /usr/local/share/cifuzz
```

If you installed cifuzz as a **non-root** user:

```bash
rm -rf "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/cifuzz" ~/.local/bin/cifuzz ~/.cmake/packages/cifuzz
```

If you installed into a custom installation directory you have to remove
that one instead.
